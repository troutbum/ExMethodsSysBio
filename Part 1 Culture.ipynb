He is interested in the proliferation and apoptosis response of cell lines to molecularly targeted therapies (e.g. EGFR inhibitors), and especially in the responses of single cells and how their variation across a cell population can contribute to drug resistance."

      "Once the seeded glioma cells have expanded to sufficient numbers, they will be treated with vehicle control, gefitinib alone, BKM120 alone, or the combination for 48 hours. Each sample of cells will be lifted from the culture dish and prepared into two equal size single cell suspensions for analysis of apoptosis and proliferation using flow cytometry. Proliferation will be assessed by a dual staining with propidium iodide and anti-BrdU FITC antibodies (a BrdU pulse will be applied prior to lifting the cells), with propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence collected on a linear scale and anti-BrdU fluorescence on a log scale. Apoptosis will be assessed by staining with Annexin-V-FITC and PI, without permeablization, with fluorescence of both collected on a log scale. In each case, excitation with a 488 nm laser will be applied, cells will be gated by FSC vs. SSC, doublets will be gated out by SSC area vs. SSC width, and then proliferative and apoptotic responses quantified via fraction of singlet cells in different gates as follows. Those cells that are BrdU positive will be considered S-phase, those with high DNA content as G2/M, and those with low DNA content as G0/G1. Those cells that are Annexin-V positive will be considered apoptotic, and those that are Annexin-V positive and PI positive as dead."

A panel of 150 such antibodies will be incubated with the cells, each labeled with a different heavy metal element."
