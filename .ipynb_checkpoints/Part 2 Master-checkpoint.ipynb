      "A recently published study demonstrated that in a brain tumor cell line with EGFR amplification and PTEN loss, the responsiveness of particular cells within the population to dual treatment with gefitinib and BKM120 was dictated by whether the ERK signaling pathway was activated or inhibited within 30 min. of drug treatment. This ERK activation happens in about 50% of the cells. However, the factors leading to this ERK pathway activation or inhibition are unclear. We are interested in understanding the signaling mechanisms that may be operating in different cells of the population to activate or inhibit ERK signaling in this way."
